# Product Vision

## Project Overview

AgentSociety is an advanced framework specifically designed for building Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents in urban simulation environments. The framework enables researchers and developers to create, manage, and simulate complex social behaviors and economic activities in controlled, virtual city environments.

## Core Purpose

AgentSociety facilitates large-scale simulation of LLM-driven generative agents to advance understanding of human behaviors and society. It provides a comprehensive platform for modeling social interactions, economic behaviors, and urban dynamics through AI agents.

## Target Users

### Primary Users
- **Academic Researchers**: Social scientists, urban planners, and AI researchers studying human behavior, social dynamics, and urban systems
- **Research Institutions**: Universities and research labs conducting social simulation experiments
- **Policy Makers**: Government agencies and think tanks modeling policy impacts on urban populations

### Secondary Users
- **Game Developers**: Creating realistic NPC behaviors in city simulation games
- **Urban Planners**: Testing urban development scenarios and their social impacts
- **AI/ML Engineers**: Developing and testing multi-agent systems

## Main Features

### Core Capabilities
- **Mind-Behavior Coupling**: Integrates LLMs' planning, memory, and reasoning capabilities to generate realistic behaviors, with support for established theories like Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Theory of Planned Behavior
- **Multi-Scale Agent Simulation**: Support for simulating hundreds to thousands of agents simultaneously with complex social interactions
- **Urban Environment Integration**: Dataset-based, text-based, and rule-based environments with varying degrees of realism and interactivity

### Advanced Features
- **Interactive Visualization**: Real-time web-based interfaces for monitoring and interacting with agents during experiments
- **Comprehensive Tooling**: Utilities for interviews, surveys, interventions, and metric recording tailored for social experimentation
- **Multi-Modal Communication**: Peer-to-peer (P2P), peer-to-group (P2G), and group chat interactions between agents
- **Flexible LLM Integration**: Compatible with multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Qwen, DeepSeek, ZhipuAI, vLLM, etc.)

### Research Applications
- **Social Polarization Studies**: Modeling echo chambers and belief reinforcement
- **Economic Behavior Analysis**: Simulating market dynamics and consumer behavior
- **Crisis Response Modeling**: Hurricane impact studies and emergency response patterns
- **Policy Impact Assessment**: UBI implementation effects and social welfare analysis
- **Information Spread Analysis**: Rumor propagation and inflammatory message dynamics

## Key Differentiators

1. **Academic Research Focus**: Purpose-built for rigorous social science research with comprehensive documentation and reproducible experiments
2. **Scale and Performance**: Distributed simulation capabilities supporting large-scale agent populations
3. **Behavioral Realism**: Advanced agent architecture with memory, context, and multi-head workflows for realistic human-like decision making
4. **Extensibility**: Modular block-based architecture allowing custom agent behaviors and environmental interactions
5. **Web-Based Interface**: Complete UI for experiment management, agent monitoring, and result visualization

## Success Metrics

- **Research Impact**: Published papers using the framework, citations in academic literature
- **Community Adoption**: Number of researchers and institutions using the platform
- **Simulation Scale**: Ability to handle increasingly large agent populations and complex scenarios
- **Experiment Reproducibility**: Successful replication of research results across different environments
